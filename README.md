JapaneseStudyGroup
==================

Code base for the Japanese Study group website.

Worked on by Tommy Rogers, et al (to be filled in later with the first commit from a new developer).

This website is made for the express purpose of tracking past and future meetings and related materials for the study
group founded by Tommy Rogers and Antoin Johnson in the beginning of 2012.
